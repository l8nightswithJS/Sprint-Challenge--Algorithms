'''
Your function should take in a single parameter (a string `word`)
Your function should return a count of how many occurences of ***"th"*** occur within `word`. Case matters.
Your function must utilize recursion. It cannot contain any loops.

def count_th(word):
    #need to sort through all letters in the word[0],
    # then sort through all letters in the substring,
    # then compare both sorted strings and return words where matches where found  
    pass    
    # TBC
