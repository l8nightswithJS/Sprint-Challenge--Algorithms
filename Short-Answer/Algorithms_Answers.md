#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
time o(n) the items are being compared as 3 times itself then function is executed so its o(n^3) a < n*n*n so a over 3 times number of items, which then has inner function at o(n2),      n3 - n2 = n = o(n)

b)
time o(n2) has two loops running o(n) plus o(n)

c)
time o(n) checking bunnies as a whole, the more that is added to length must be added to processing time  
## Exercise II
1st create range for room floors,
2nd binary search, checking if floor is higher or lower than f,
3rd append results of non broken eggs to new array

time complexity o(n)
