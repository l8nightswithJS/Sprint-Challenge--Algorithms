#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
time o(n) the items are being compared as 3 times itself then function is executed so its o(n^3) a < n*n*n so a over 3 times number of items, which then has inner function at o(n2),      n3 - n2 = n = o(n)

b)
time o(n2) has two loops running o(n) plus o(n)

c)
time o(n) checking bunnies as a whole more that is added to length must be added to processing time  
## Exercise II
1st create range for room floors,
2nd sort floor at which eggs are dropped,
3rd compare both arrays,
4th assign value of desired output to new array 

i in range(floors)
i in (floorsdroppedat)
sort (floorsdroppedat)
compare (floorsdroppedat) < (floorrangeval(f))
append data

time complexity o(n2)
